title:  "The Danger in Prescriptive Solutions"
---

So often in our lives people unwittingly prescribe particular solutions, often without realizing it.
This can be dangerous and lead to ineffective or inefficient solutions.

As a good steward and partner, it's important recognize the difference between a need and a prescribed solution, and to solve the former.
If you blindly implement a prescribed solution, you often invest significant effort only to learn you built the wrong thing.

>Dig beyond prescriptive solutions to solve underlying needs

Here's a simple example showing the power of communicating needs rather than prescriptive solutions:

*Prescriptive solution:* I want a structure built of red brick, with 4 walls, and be 8 feet tall.

*Underlying need:* I need to keep my bike from getting wet when it rains

Aha! So could we instead:

1. reuse an existing structure
2. cover your bike with a tarp
3. build a structure but with different materials
4. build a structure but with different specifications

Digging beyond a prescriptive solution to solve the underlying need allows us to re-evaluate a need from first principles.
This opens up a whole new world of creative solutions to best address the need.
