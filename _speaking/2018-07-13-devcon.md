description: "I gave this talk to share lessons I had learned from 4 years building modern cloud-based software in the federal government. Our team had previously launched the first cloud-based system at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and successfully integrated numerous Silicon Valley software development practices into the agency. I lost the speaker notes, so I only have the slides for this talk. I like to use a lot of gifs in my talks which don't always come through in the slide images."
