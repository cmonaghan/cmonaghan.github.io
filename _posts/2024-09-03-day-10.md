Today I started on a chatbot that responds as Socrates. I started a repo here: [https://github.com/cmonaghan/chatbot-socrates](https://github.com/cmonaghan/chatbot-socrates)

While I'm sure there are Socrates chatbots already out there, I want to train the model myself on a custom dataset. I found [open-source text versions of Plato's Socratic Dialogues](https://archive.org/details/platsd), though at 317k lines of unstructured text, it would take a fair bit of data cleaning before this could be used to train a model.

I started familiarizing myself with some of the core python libraries like `transformers` and existing [Hugging Face datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) where I found a few existing datasets on Socratic dialogues such as this one:

I got a simple dev environment setup where I can run the GPT-2 model locally:

    from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

    # Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
    model_name = "gpt2"  # You can start with GPT-2 and later switch to GPT-3/4
    model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
    tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

    def generate_response(prompt):
        inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
        outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=150, num_return_sequences=1, no_repeat_ngram_size=2,
                                top_p=0.95, top_k=60)
        response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
        return response

    # Test the function with a philosophical question
    user_input = "What is the meaning of life?"
    print(generate_response(user_input))

When running this, I got three answers, none of which are very good, but it's a start!
