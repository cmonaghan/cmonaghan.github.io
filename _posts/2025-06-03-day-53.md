title:  "100 Days of Gen AI: Final Day"
---

It's been a while since I last wrote. It's not that I haven't been working on my 100 days of AI. It's just that I've been preoccupied with a cross-country move from Washington DC to San Francisco. In the intervening time I've experimented with many tools both at work and in my personal projects. I've become a power user at some of those. I've built and deployed several small applications exploring different tools and AI use cases. And most importantly, I have started planning a new project which I'm calling a "Personal Data Vault". It's essentially context management for AI personal assistants. 

I probably won't be writing much more from here on out. Mostly because I want to focus on building right now.

I haven't quite reached 100 days of posts, but I also haven't recorded many of the days I spent along the way. And more importantly, I've achieved the goal I set out at the beginning -- to build familiarity and proficiency with the latest technology and tools around GenAI so I can build great things.
