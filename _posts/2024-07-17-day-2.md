Today was more prep work and setup rather than new learning.

I joined the Azure AI Community Discord server, which proved more complicated than expected. It turns out I had an old Discord account using my phone number, and I needed to do a song and dance to unlink my phone number from the old account, delete the existing Discord servers associated with that account, delete the account itself, and then link my phone number to my new account. Once on Discord I looked through some of the message history in the #ai-studio channel and it was interesting to see some of the different types of projects people are building.

I also created an Azure account using an existing Microsoft Live account that I apparently had. This is my first time using Azure!

Baby steps!

Goals for tomorrow:
1. See if there is any way to get access to the Azure OpenAI service and an API key in order to complete the [coding portions of the course](https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/#/00-course-setup/README?wt.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst&id=lessons-and-technical-requirements)
2. Get started on the course even if I must skip the coding portions
3. Get more familiar with the Azure AI Community Discord groups
