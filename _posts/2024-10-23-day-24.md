Today I continued working on the Terraform Cloud slackbot for Benchling. I fixed a few bugs (slack sending retries and bedrock responding to the query multiple times), improved logging, and generally got it ready for production. I started importing my existing resources into terraform, where I will version control and manage these resources going forward.

Next up is finalizing the terraform definitions, then to try redeploying the service from scratch to make sure I didn't miss any resources, IAM permissions, etc.
