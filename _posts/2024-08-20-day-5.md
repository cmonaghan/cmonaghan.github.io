I started on a new mini-project called **Fallacy Finder** using the ChatGPT API. It's a simple tool that takes in a block of text and returns any fallacies present.

Next I want to build a page that displays the fallacy type, the text that demonstrates this, and a brief explanation of why this is a fallacy. This mini-project allows me to test out the `json_object` response format. I considered using ChatGPT's new "functions" feature but it didn't seem right since we're not calling another API or tool. We're just rendering the results into a table for the user.

Here's a mockup:
