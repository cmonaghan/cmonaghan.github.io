Time for a new project! 

Today I've decided to try something less about coding, and more about deep thinking and ideation. 

I'm interested in emergent new opportunities for AI to solve problems that were previously intractable due to the high cost of human labor. For example, each of these are impracticle at scale because they are too time-intensive for humans: 
* content moderation
* qualitative user surveys
* respond to all user feedback
* personal assistants
* build custom personal software
* skip customer service phone tree and talk to an empowered agent
* design custom clothing

Let's see what new areas we can explore with OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.5 Deep Research.

### My Prompt
> I'm an entrepreneur who is exploring new business opportunities that will now be possible with AI. In particular, I'd like to explore use cases and ideas that have never been addressed before because human labor is too expensive. Some example of this might be: respond to all user feedback, qualitative user surveys, content moderation, personal assistants, build custom personal software, skip customer service phone tree and talk to an empowered agent, design custom clothing, every industry where good software is lacking, etc. Can you help me by thinking carefully, and coming up with 40 problem spaces that were never addressed before, but now could be with AI?

### Digging in

Impressive. Many of these are reasonable ideas. Though some of them are a bit vague and may not be practical to implement. The one that jumped out at me (because it addressed a problem I myself have) is "31. AI-powered Product Design Feedback: Instant, detailed consumer feedback on new product prototypes."

I'm curious to dig into that further, but before I do, let's first see if we can generate another 40 ideas so that we have 80 total, then winnow the list down based on size of the market, competitive landscape, and match to my own skills.

I'll spare you the full answers, but there are a few answers just sound like AI bullshitting:
* "Continuous AI-powered Employee Engagement Monitoring. Why? Large enterprise HR tech market; applicable to any organization above mid-size. Your web/cloud expertise is ideal for real-time, cloud-based analytics dashboards." - "cloud-based analytics dashboards" is just a jumble of buzzwords with no substantive meaning.
* "Multi-tenant AI Compliance Assistant. What: AI-driven SaaS assisting companies with continuous compliance monitoring and audits for frameworks like SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, etc." - What's multi-tenant about this?

I then dug further into idea 31. It provided helpful guidance in assessing the idea. It also pointed me at 6 other competitors in the space. ChatGPT provided a summary of each competitor's value proposition, plus I also scoped out each of their webpages myself. None of them seem to do exactly what I envision here, which is to have an AI agent actually interact with a webpage and flag anything that is confusing, missing features, etc.

### Conclusion

This was a helpful research assistant that pushed me to think of additional ideas and generally augmented my own thought process. It felt like I was working with a teammate, and together we could come up with better solutions. This made me think of Ethan Mollick's recent post [The Cybernetic Teammate](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-cybernetic-teammate) where individuals *with* AI performed better than teams *without* AI.

This certainly seems to be the case in my experience today.

(Note that Ethan's post also goes on to show that for the top 10% of ideas, teams did perform better than individuals, both with and without AI; human teams do still add considerable value.)
