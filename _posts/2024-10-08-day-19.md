title:  "100 Days of Gen AI: Day 19"

I spent the morning reading about OpenAI's tools for [Fine Tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning), [Model Distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation) and [Evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals). I think model distillation could be a way to make my planned "Terraform Cloud at Benchling" chatbot more cost efficient (not that cost efficiency is particularly critical for the volume of requests I expect it to get).

I've also been thinking about a future where content moderation (via LLMs) is a standard feature on our digital  platforms, which (in the most hopeful case) could lead to a kinder internet.

I wonder, what kind of content moderation tools exist out there today? OpenAI actually has a post on this topic: [Using GPT-4 for content moderation](https://openai.com/index/using-gpt-4-for-content-moderation/). This blog post was also instructive about the [content moderation space](https://getstream.io/blog/ai-content-moderation/) and its various technical approaches. It also looks like OpenAI released a [content moderation endpoint in 2022](https://openai.com/index/new-and-improved-content-moderation-tooling/), which is documented in [its latest form here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation).

Not a lot of coding today, so I'm feeling less accomplished, but this is still learning!
