This is my first post. It's not supposed to be good. It's supposed to bad. It's supposed to get me writing.

I've aspired to get in the habit of writing and sharing my ideas for a few years now, but have never gotten over the hurdle of being too self-conscious and too much of a perfectionist to ever let anything I create see the light of day.

So I'm going to write a first post and it's going to be bad. I'm just going to write it in 20 min and post it. I won't even endlessly obsess over it and second-guess myself. I need to get comfortable with posting bad writing, because let's be honest, most of what I write is probably going to be bad.

I don't know what exactly this blog will turn into. Based on my thinking today, maybe this blog can be a place to share all manner of my thoughts and ideas on a wide range of topics, from personal adventures, to entrepreneurship, to software, to government, to whatever else I find captivating. Maybe posts will be short -- just a few sentences. Maybe they will be long. Or maybe some posts won't be writing at all, but video or images or music or interactive content.

What will my writing voice be? I have no idea. I guess we'll find out.

Where should I host this? I really like the site Medium, but they have their own format they are aiming for, which is writing-based and medium-length posts of 3-15 minutes of reading time. What if I want to occasionally write short one-line posts like Seth Godin does on his blog? Or create something interactive, like Bret Victor's worrydream? Or post something that's an image or video only? That might be too constraining. I'd rather host it myself and retain complete control -- more rope to hang myself I guess.

Well, here goes...
