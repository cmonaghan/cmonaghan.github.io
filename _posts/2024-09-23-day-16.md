Today I focused on getting the backend slackbot server hosted on AWS Lambda.

This proved more complicated than expected since I haven't used my personal laptop to connect to AWS via CLI in over a year. Many of my libraries are outdated, user credentials long expired, etc. I made some progress getting my local development environment cleaned up, but after 1.5 hours I still don't have anything deployed on AWS Lambda. :/
