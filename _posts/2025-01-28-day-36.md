Today I kept working on the Apple Siri shortcut. I updated how tokens are managed in Redis such that a subsequent login will reuse the existing API token rather than create a new one. I also added functionality to add a song to a pre-determined playlist, and then got most of the way through adding the ability to remove a song from a playlist. We're getting close to completion now.
