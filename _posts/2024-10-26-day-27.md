Today I did a few things:
1. Verify incoming requests are actually from Slack
2. Wrote out several unit tests

I used ChatGPT 4o Canvas for both of these tasks. It did perfectly on the first task, running correctly after the first shot (though I subsequently did some minor refactoring). But the unit testing took several rounds of back and forth and it completely failed on writing the last (more complicated) test no matter how many times I tried with ChatGPT. All of the unit tests it wrote failed from various errors on the first run. Sometimes feeding the error back to ChatGPT was enough to solve it, sometimes not.
