Today I continued working on connecting the Lambda to Bedrock for the Benchling Terraform Cloud slackbot. It took a bit of time to get the IAM permissions sorted out and the boto3 calls working correctly.

Two things that made this process take longer than it might have otherwise were:
* Lambda default timeout of 3 sec without a helpful error message (Bedrock takes more than 3 sec to respond)
* Lambda running a much older version of boto3, meaning the API documentation I was following was much newer and led to much head-scratching (the Bedrock API has changed considerably between those boto3 versions)
