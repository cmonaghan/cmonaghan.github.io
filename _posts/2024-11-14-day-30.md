I read lots about fine-tuning today. I started with the [OpenAI Fine-Tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning#common-use-cases) documentation, then branched out into several blog posts and perused many datasets on Hugging Face. My goal is to try fine-tuning as a learning opportunity. I'd like to work with a dataset small enough that I can run the fine-tuning training on my (brand new!) M4 laptop.

Some fine-tuning ideas could be train a model to:
- generate text in my personal voice and style
- recognize my face in a photo
- recognize a product from a photo
- what are the chances I will like a given article of clothing based on its characteristics (fabric, price, country of origin)

Just some ideas, none of them original, but perhaps useful as a learning exercise.
