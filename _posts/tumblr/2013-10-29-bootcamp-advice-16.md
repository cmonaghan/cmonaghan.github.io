<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/its-a-trap.jpg" width="60%" align="right">Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a Dev Bootcamp Chicago alum. This email exchange took place in August 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the student ‘John’.

<b>My Email:</b>

Hey John,

Thanks for your response. I’m unavailable the next two evenings, but since I only have 3 short questions, maybe I can just ask you via email:

1) What is your opinion of the overall quality of the program?

2) How difficult was it to find a job upon graduating?

3) If you had to choose, would you do Dev Bootcamp all over again?

Thanks for your help and I appreciate your time!

Best,

Christian

<b>Email Response:</b>

Here you go:

1) What is your opinion of the overall quality of the program?

> I attended DevBootcamp in Chicago. It would have been very unlikely for me to learn as much as I did in those few months by myself. The students, teachers and mentors made it a strong learning environment. I walked away with skills, friendships, a strong network, and my expectations exceeded.

2) How difficult was it to find a job upon graduating?

> A lot of factors at play here. Difficulty depends on your previous background, how much effort you put into the program, and where you want to end up. Some students come in with engineering backgrounds and a bunch of coding experience, some come in with no experience at all. There will naturally be an advantage for the former. However, if you put in the effort, there are more than enough resources to get you prepared for a job afterwards. I’m currently in the Bay Area, so job openings can get competitive here, moreso than other areas in the US, but the # of hiring companies is still enormous.

3) If you had to choose, would you do Dev Bootcamp all over again?

> Knowing what I know now, I would investigate more into other programs and see if I’m leaning hard in any particular direction beforehand (more visual front-end work, more back-end work, iPhone, Android?). I’ve heard great things about Hack Reactor, App Academy, Bloc, Mobile Makers, etc. But at the end of the day, Dev Bootcamp turned out to be a good match for myself in that I learned the full-stack (both front-end and back-end technologies), which is where I want to be working in.

Feel free to contact me whenever!

John
