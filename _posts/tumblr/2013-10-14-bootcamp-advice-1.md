Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a technical recruiter at a 400-person Bay Area-based tech company in June 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the recruiter ‘John’ and the company ‘Widgets Inc.’

My email:
Hi John,Thanks for connecting. I’m applying to Dev Bootcamp & App Academy in San Francisco with the goal of being hired as a junior web developer in Ruby on Rails upon graduation. Widgets Inc. is listed as a partner employer so I wanted to reach out and see if you have any experience with bootcamp graduates as a recruiter.I have 3 questions:1) Are you currently hiring any junior web developers in San Francisco? (Is the market for junior developers really as hot as they say)2) In your experience, do you feel that these bootcamps adequately prepare graduates to be successful as developers upon graduation?3) In your experience, is one of these bootcamp programs superior as far as quality of graduates, programming proficiency, etc.?Thanks for your help John. This is a huge investment of time and money for me, so I want to make sure there’s something at the end of the tunnel.Thanks,Christian

Email Response:
Hey Christian,Thanks for reaching out. Oh the Dev bootcamps and App Academies…So i have mixed thoughts on these programs.1.) Yes the market is very hot right now for Developers/Engineers especially in RoR or JavaScript oriented languages. Is Widgets Inc. currently hiring Jr. Developers? as of right now, no. But we do have jr. positions open every once in awhile. but currently we don’t have any openings.2.) We have hired a couple of developers through Dev Bootcamp/App Academy. However, there are two types of candidates that come out of those programs. a.) they have a Computer Science degree, and are taking the course to learn Rails. b.) want to get into programming, but don’t have a technical foundation (CS degree)Usually the ones with the CS degree stand out much more than the candidates that are trying to get into programming. Now, dont get me wrong, we hire engineers without degree’s and they are amazing contributors that have a self-taught background. But to answer your original question, yes they prepare you, but i think it all depends on what your working on and the languages being used. I hope that answers your second question.3.) I feel both do a good job at preparing their graduates about the real-world of coding. so i don’t really have an answer on which one stands out. I do believe that they reimburse your tuition, if you are hired through one of their career fairs. Anyway, let me know if you have any other questions.Best,John
