Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a Dev Bootcamp alum. This email exchange took place in August 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the student ‘John’.

My Email:
Hi John,Thanks for offering advice from your experience at Dev Bootcamp. I’m trying to make an informed decision between the various coding bootcamps available and any insights you can provide are much appreciated. I have 3 questions:1) What is your opinion of the overall quality of the program?2) How difficult was it to find a job upon graduating?3) If you had to choose, would you do Dev Bootcamp all over again?Thanks for your help and I appreciate your time!Best,Christian
Email Response:
Hi Christian,If you have the opportunity, go for it. DBC was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. The instruction was great, pace was ridiculous and I learned more in 9 weeks than in certain years of college.I came in with a job, but most of my cohort and those before mine quit before starting. Job hunting is definitely big in everyone’s minds, but this is a pretty smoking hot market for developers so no one expects to have a huge amount of trouble. It usually takes folks less than a month to find a job they really like.I’d do it over again, no question, but everyone’s situation is different. What’s your story - what are you up to now, and what are you interested in doing?Feel free to give me a call if the LinkedIn messaging thing is a little too back-and-forth.Good luck,John
