<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/ohm-advice.png" width="30%" align="right">Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a current Hack Reactor student who was near the end of the program at the time I contacted him. This email exchange took place in August 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the student ‘John’.

Hi John, 

I’m applying to Hack Reactor in addition to a few other coding bootcamps in San Francisco. I would love to hear any advice you can give to help me make an informed decision. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your experience at Hack Reactor?

<b>LinkedIn Response:</b>

Hi Christian,

thank you for reaching out. You are not the first applicant who’s contacted me for my opinion and experience, here’s what I’ve told the other applicant:

the short answer is, hack reactor is the number 1 dev bootcamp on the market today. tech recruiter specifically target hack reactor students. in terms of curriculum, get a detailed low down on this [quora post](http://www.quora.com/Hack-Reactor/How-does-Hack-Reactor-justify-its-higher-cost) from one of the co-founders, Marcus.

I can testify ever word from that post. Marcus is one of the best teacher i’ve ever had from any type of learning environment. he’s extremely dedicated to his craft of teaching computer scienceespecially after finishing half of the program now, i can honestly tell you that if i had to choose again, i would not even consider applying to any of the other competitors, namely app academy or dev bootcamp. i dont even consider any of the other bootcamps, besides the two listed, close to the same caliber. I happen to have just attended app academy’s open house / hiring day last friday to checkout the competition, and boy am I glad I haven chosen hack reactor. Besides the obvious fact that hack reactor provides far superior facility and equipments, the students I talked to at app academy told me they wished they were taught more javascript and nodejs

Hack Reactor’s curriculum is very comprehensive, and very challenging. the staff is here until late night with the students helping on the projects. the last 3 weeks of the program focus heavily on helping you to recruit, very supportive system to make sure you get an awesome joblet me know if you have specific questions, i’d be happy to do my best to answer

John
