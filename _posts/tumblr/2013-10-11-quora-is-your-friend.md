<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/quora-logo.jpg" width="60%" align="right">Before I did any emailing or asking others for advice, I first trolled the internets to find anything that could help educate my decision. As I see it, there were two major choices to make once I decided I wanted to become a programmer:

1. What language should I learn?
2. How can I best learn to become a great programmer?

<b>Here are some of the more useful Quora posts I read:</b>

<b>And this was my takeaway:</b>

1. Which language? - The language isn’t all that important. Just choose one. (Since I want to learn web development, I was considering Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.) I chose JavaScript.

2. How to learn best? - For me, I knew I would have the highest chance of success if I enrolled in a structured coding program. Self-study may work for some, but since I work full-time and have a busy life outside of work, I knew self-study wouldn’t be a good choice for me.
