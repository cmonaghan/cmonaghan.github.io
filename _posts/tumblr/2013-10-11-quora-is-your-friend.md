Before I did any emailing or asking others for advice, I first trolled the internets to find anything that could help educate my decision. As I see it, there were two major choices to make once I decided I wanted to become a programmer:
What language should I learn?
How can I best learn to become a great programmer?

Here are some of the more useful Quora posts I read:
Why are so many coding bootcamps focused on Ruby on Rails?
Why do so many startups use Ruby on Rails?
Who is hiring JavaScript programmers purely for their JavaScript skills?
Why is learning JavaScript important for web developers?
Is it better to learn Python or JavaScript as a first language?
What is the best way to learn JavaScript?
What are the advantages of Ruby over Python?
How does Hack Reactor justify its higher cost?
I’m interested in attending a Programming Bootcamp. How do I decide between Dev Bootcamp and Hack Reactor?
Who hires junior developers from programming bootcamps (like Hack Reactor or Dev Bootcamp) with less than a year experience?
How should I prepare for Dev Bootcamp?
What kinds of projects are Dev Bootcamp grads working on in their new jobs?
Do companies hiring from Dev Bootcamp care about degree or experience?
Need help deciding which bootcamp (gSchool, Dev Bootcamp, App Academy)?
What has been students’ experiences with mobile app development bootcamps like App Academy?

And this was my takeaway:
Which language? - The language isn’t all that important. Just choose one. (Since I want to learn web development, I was considering Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.) I chose JavaScript.
How to learn best? - For me, I knew I would have the highest chance of success if I enrolled in a structured coding program. Self-study may work for some, but since I work full-time and have a busy life outside of work, I knew self-study wouldn’t be a good choice for me.
