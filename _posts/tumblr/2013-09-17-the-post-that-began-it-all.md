<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/the-post-that-began-it-all.jpg" width="60%" align="right">This is my first post! You dear reader, are part of history, so relish the moment. I’m writing this blog to chronicle my journey as I learn to program. I first started teaching myself some basic HTML and CSS about a year ago, one thing led to the next, and now I find myself about to make a radical career change in order to become a full-time programmer. I thought it would be a great idea to bring my readers along for the ride and tell them the harrowing stories about all my seat-of-the-pants action.

Here’s my programming story so far:

I started teaching myself HTML and CSS on w3schools about a year ago. Probably not the best choice, but I didn’t really know what I was doing, and fortunately HTML and CSS are easy enough to learn. My intention was simply to learn some coding basics and satisfy my curiosity about how webpages are made. After that I built a very basic page. Static webpages are boring, so I started learning Javascript by taking the free Codecademy course. I would work on the course for an hour before work each day, and after a month or two I finished the course. It was my first experience with any real kind of programming, and learning javascript was quite fun and rewarding. If you have absolutely no coding experience, but are interested in trying it out, I highly recommend Codecademy for getting your feet wet. By the end of the course I was able to build a simple blackjack game.

Afterwards I built a simple bill-splitting application for roommates that only kind of worked. I also love to play cribbage, so with my newfound skills I built an app to calculate various cards that could be thrown into your crib, with the goal of maximizing the expected value of your hand. I built it in Javascript and it ended up taking way longer than I thought. This is mostly because I didn’t quite know what I was doing, so I ended up building it in a way that made it very hard to read and quite opaque when trying to fix any bugs.
So that’s how I got hooked.
