Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a recently-hired engineer and former bootcamp graduate who is now at a 50-person Bay Area-based tech company. This email exchange took place in June 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the employee ‘John’ and the company ‘Widgets Inc.’

My email:
Hi,
Congrats on your new round of financing! This may be an unusual request, but I’m applying to Dev Bootcamp with the goal of being hired as a junior web developer upon graduation. Widgets Inc. is listed on Dev Bootcamp’s site as a partner employer so I wanted to reach out to you and ask a few questions about your experience with Dev Bootcamp graduates.
I have 3 questions:
1) Are you currently hiring any junior web developers? (Is the market for junior developers really as hot as they say)
2) In your experience, do you feel that Dev Bootcamp adequately prepare graduates to be successful as developers upon graduation?
3) Is there anything else you feel I should know before I go through the time and expense of Dev Bootcamp or a similar program?
I appreciate your time. This is a huge investment for me and your advice will help me make the right decision. Thanks for your help!
Cheers,
Christian

Email Response:
Hi Christian,
My colleague forwarded me your email. My name is John, and I graduated from Dev Bootcamp in Summer of 2012. I’ve been with Widgets Inc. since September, and am one of three Dev Bootcamp grads on a five person team.
To answer your questions:1) We are not actively looking for any more Juniors. We probably won’t be looking for Junior Devs until early-mid next year.
The market is hot. If you are good, you WILL get picked up by a company. There is a huge shortage of quality senior/mid devs, and a lot of companies are looking to groom junior/entry level devs to fill those roles.
2) I think Dev Bootcamp has done a great job of preparing me for the web development world. Within 3 months, I was starting to feel comfortable coding at a production level, and by the 6 month mark, I was flying, working in both Rails and AngularJS, another web framework.
Dev Bootcamp focuses on teaching their students how to write clean, scalable code with the right principles backing them. In reading other code around the community, I can confidently say that we were taught best practices that are highly valued, but are not always used by other engineers. Through this, we gain a competitive advantage over others who are theoretically stronger.
3) Make sure you WANT to code. Take tutorials. Go through the frustration of writing a program, debugging. Feel the satisfaction of building something. If you don’t love coding, then it’s going to be hard to make it through the program and be as successful as some of the people in the stories that have been published.
Best of luck!
John
