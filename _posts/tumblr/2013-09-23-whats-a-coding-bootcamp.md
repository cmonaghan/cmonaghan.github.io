Around the time I was working on my cribbage program, I was talking to a web developer friend, and he mentioned that I should look into a coding bootcamp. I had never heard of these, but I quickly did some research and learned it’s a program that in 9-12 intense weeks teaches you the skills to become a web developer. No prior experience necessary. I had never seriously considered becoming a web developer for a career, but as I read more about it, I became increasingly interested. I eventually ended up doing an inordinate amount of research into the various programs, and then finally applied to Dev Bootcamp, Hack Reactor and App Academy. Some other programs I looked into included Coding Dojo, and General Assembly. (Hackbright Academy also looked interesting, but being for women only, I was kind of out luck on that one.) I’ll go into more detail on my selection process in a future post.
