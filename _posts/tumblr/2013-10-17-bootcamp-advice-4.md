<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/tax-accountant-advice.jpg" width="60%" align="right">Here is a transcript of the advice I received from the COO of a 50-employee SF-based tech startup. This email exchange took place in June 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the COO ‘John’ and the company ‘Widgets Inc.’

<b>My Email:</b>

Hi there!

I’m applying to Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco with the goal of beinghired as a junior web developer upon graduation. Widgets Inc. islisted on Dev Bootcamp’s site as a partner employer so I wanted toreach out to you and ask a few questions about your experience withbootcamp graduates.

I have 2 questions:

1) Are you currently hiring any junior web developers in SanFrancisco? (Is the market for junior developers really as hot as theysay)

2) In your experience, do you feel that these bootcamps adequatelyprepare graduates to be successful as developers upon graduation?

I appreciate your time. This is a huge investment for me and youradvice will help me make the right decision. Thanks for your help!

Cheers,

Christian

Hey Christian,

Thanks for getting in touch with us, and we’re happy to see your interest in one of the bootcamp programs here in SF. I’d be happy to answer your two questions.

First, we aren’t currently hiring any juniors, but that’s mostly because we just hired a good chunk of engineers, and a number of those were juniors. There is certainly a good market here for engineers of all seniority levels, as we’ve hired close to 15 total in the last year. I can’t speak for other employers, but I know that many of the graduates from bootcamp get placed at a variety of different companies, large and small, so there certainly is demand.

As for your second question, I think how you exit DBC really depends on what you put into the program. It’s intense, so it requires quite a bit of effort, but everyone we’ve talked to really loves the experience. We’ve hired quite a few from DBC, HackReactor, General Assembly, and others, and a number of those engineers have turned out to be some of our strongest here. I think they do a great job of teaching you the fundamentals you need to be successful, but for us, the key is seeing what else you’ve done beyond what was merely assigned to you. Working on a side project or developing something unique with the skills you learn there is really what can set apart a candidate from others. Seeing the application of this new stuff you learned to something you may be passionate about or to a problem you’ve wanted to solve, but previously didn’t know how really shows potential, and that’s what we look for!

Hope those answers are helpful. Let me know if I can answer anything else for you!

Best,

-John
