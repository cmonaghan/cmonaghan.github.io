<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/balance-stones.jpg" width="60%" align="right">Before making the decision to apply to a coding bootcamp, I did an inordinate amount of research into various programs. I emailed dozens of employers, bootcamp graduates, recruiters, and of course the schools themselves. I spent about 2 months thoroughly exploring the various options until I felt that I truly understood the costs and benefits, and knew what I could reasonably expect to get out of each program.

Fortunately for you, I did most of this research via email or LinkedIn which means I have all these conversations saved for posterity in the depths of my email. In order to help out the next generation of bootcamp applicants, Iâ€™m going to reproduce each of my conversations here so you can learn what I learned. In order to protect the privacy of those who generously offered their advice, all individual names and the names of their affiliated companies will be redacted.
