<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/charlie-brown-advice.jpg" width="60%" align="right">Here is a transcript of the advice I received from the cofounder of a small SF-based tech startup. This email exchange took place in June 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the cofounder ‘John’ and the company ‘Widgets Inc.’

<b>My Email:</b>

Hi there,

This may be an unusual request, but I’m applying to Dev Bootcamp with the goal of becoming a junior web developer. Widgets Inc. is listed on their site as a partner employer so I wanted to reach out to you and ask a few questions about your experience with Dev Bootcamp graduates in order to make sure this program will adequately prepare me for a job upon graduation.

I have 3 questions:

1) Are you currently hiring junior web developers? (I only see senior developer listed on your site. Is the market for junior developers really as hot as they say)

2) In your experience, do you feel that Dev Bootcamp adequately prepare graduates to be successful as junior developers upon graduation?

3) Is there anything else you feel I should know before I go through the time and expense of Dev Bootcamp or a similar program?

I appreciate your time. This is a huge investment for me and your advice will help me make the right decision. Thanks for your help!

Cheers,

Christian

<b>Email Response:</b>

Hi Christian,

Happy to answer some questions:

1) Are you currently hiring junior web developers? (I only see senior developer listed on your site. Is the market for junior developers really as hot as they say)

> We are only currently hiring developers with experience, however I definitely think that other companies out there are hiring junior developers. We hired one person out of Dev Bootcamp thus far. My brother went through Dev Bootcamp and found a great job coming out.

2) In your experience, do you feel that Dev Bootcamp adequately prepare graduates to be successful as junior developers upon graduation?

> I think it depends on the candidate, how hard they work, and how well they can grasp the fundamentals of coding.

3) Is there anything else you feel I should know before I go through the time and expense of Dev Bootcamp or a similar program?

> It is just like school, you will get out what you put in, but you will have a marketable skill.

Best of luck!

John
