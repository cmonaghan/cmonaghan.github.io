The day is upon us! Today will be my first day at Hack Reactor. Iâ€™ve now had a week off since I quit my job, to decompress and prepare for the course. I used that time for a quick trip to relax on a tropical beach in Panama, courtesy of frequent flyer miles. Upon returning on Saturday I shaved my head and had a party to celebrate my new beginning. I plan not to cut my hair or shave for the duration of the course (except maybe at the end for job interviews). Now my skill at coding can be measured by the length of my hair and beard. (Some say dorky, I say baller.)
Hack Reactor here I come!
