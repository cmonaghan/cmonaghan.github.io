Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a Dev Bootcamp alum. This email exchange took place in August 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the student ‘John’.

My Email:
Hi John,Congrats on your new job at Widgets Inc! Thanks for offering advice from your experience at Dev Bootcamp. I’m trying to make an informed decision between the various coding bootcamps available and any insights you can provide are much appreciated. I have 3 questions:1) What is your opinion of the overall quality of the program?2) How difficult was it to find a job upon graduating?3) If you had to choose, would you do Dev Bootcamp all over again?Thanks for your help and I appreciate your time!Best,Christian
Email Response:
Thanks! 1.) I think the overall quality was reasonable. The program was relatively well structured and helped me gain the foundations of how to code. A lot of the work that has helped me succeed was outside of the classroom, but in general I think it was a good experience.2.) I had a background in Applied Math, so that certainly helped me get a job after Devbootcamp as it is also an engineering discipline. It didn’t take me very long to find great job offers.3.) At the time there weren’t many other options to Devbootcamp so I would have done it again. Saying that, it looks the price has gone up considerably. I would look into other programs that were maybe cheaper. I assume the various programs that are run don’t teach you much that is all that different because there is only so much you can learn with 2-3 months. A lot of it is just gaining the foundation in order to learn at a more reasonable pace on your own.Let me know if you have any other questions. Hope this was helpful!
