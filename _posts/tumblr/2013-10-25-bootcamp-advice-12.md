<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/homer-advice.jpg" width="60%" align="right">Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a Hack Reactor alum. This email exchange took place in August 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the student ‘Jane’.


<b>My Email:</b>

Hi Jane,

Congrats on the new job! And thanks for offering advice from your experience at Hack Reactor. I’m trying to make an informed decision between the various coding bootcamps available and any insights you can provide are much appreciated.

I have 3 questions:

1) What is your opinion of the overall quality of the program?

2) How difficult was it to find a job upon graduating?

3) If you had to choose, would you do Hack Reactor all over again?

Thanks for your help and I appreciate your time!

Best,

Christian

Hi Christian,

Quality is somewhat of a difficult thing to judge since it’s somewhat arbitrary in this instance. I will say that the curriculum is well thought out and tested, as a student we gave a lot of feedback, almost all of it was acted on in some shape or form (this was in the form of one on ones with the staff and also as a class). 

There are two teachers in particular who stand out in my mind as two of the best I’ve had in my life ( I went to a private school). The head instructor Marcus takes time to make sure he explains things in a eloquent and passionate way and leaves no man behind, questions are encouraged almost to a fault. The other thing that stands out is how much help you get during coding time, they have a well thought out help request system that gets an instructor to your side as fast as possible.

Compared to other schools hack reactor is just full of love, love for the code and for each other. The mentality is what’s good for one of us is good for all and we all taught each other things which in turn helped us cement the ideas in our own head.

Very few people from my class are still looking for a job. Upon graduating about half of the class had offers, myself included ( I had two at that time). Most of the people still looking are only doing so because they are in the process with larger companies (twitter, apple) and those tend to take time.

If you couldn’t tell already I would definitely do hack reactor again. I think everyone in my class would say the same. (we had no one drop out)

If you’re looking for a place where you won’t be on your own working through learning to code and enjoy being around people who are motivated and excited hack reactor is the place for you.

Have you been accepted already? What other places were you looking at?

Hi Jane,


Thank you for your thoughtful responses. This is very helpful feedback. So far I’ve had one skype interview with Tony, and I have an in-person interview at Hack Reactor this evening. I’m currently also considering Dev Bootcamp and App Academy. I wasn’t initially considering Hack Reactor because I was set on learning Ruby and had heard that Hack Reactor was front-end development only. Tony assured me that people often mistake HR for front-end-only curriculum but that they teach full stack. From everything I’ve been learning about Hack Reactor via Quora threads, the HR blog, talking with Tony, and messaging a number of alums and current students, Hack Reactor is looking like my top choice. So far I’ve only heard glowing feedback, and the likelihood of finding a job afterwards (100%) is very compelling evidence for the value of the program.

As a relative beginner to coding, I don’t have a great perception of the values and trade-offs between JavaScript vs Ruby. I’ve read a number of posts and blogs about the benefits/drawbacks of each, but it’s not always easy to separate motives and opinions. Why did you choose to learn JavaScript over Ruby?


Thanks Jane!


Christian

I didn’t chose to learn js over ruby. Hr actually teaches both. JavaScript is just what they teach the most of. The way I see it is they’re teaching you how to learn. I feel comfortable picking up any language now and will probably eventually make my way to C. 

Good luck in your interview. Remember they’re not looking for rock star coders they’re looking for teachable people. Keep an open mind and always talk about what you’re thinking while you’re coding. 

Jane
