<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/internet-advice.gif" width="60%" align="right">Here is a transcript of the advice I received from the cofounder of a 200-employee Silicon Valley-based tech startup. This email exchange took place in July 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the cofounder ‘John’ and the company ‘Widgets Inc.’

<b>My Email:</b>

Hi John,

Thanks for offering to help. I’m teaching myself to program and want to eventually work as a software engineer for a startup in the Bay Area/San Francisco.

I have two questions:

1) Do you have any experience hiring junior developers directly from coding bootcamps? (such as Dev Bootcamp, App Academy, Hack Reactor, etc.)

2) What languages/frameworks are in the highest demand in the job market? (ie - Ruby on Rails, Python, Javascript, etc.)

I appreciate your help and thank you in advance!

Christian


<b>Email Response:</b>

We don’t have any experience hiring junior developers from one of these bootcamps. I would assume that we’d hire them more-or-less as an intern to start.

Ruby on Rails is very in-demand, but most bigger shops stop using it (as we did) once they grow beyond what it can handle size-wise. Java, Javascript, Python, etc are all broadly useful. I wouldn’t focus too much on the specific language- I mean, it certainly is something we look at, but good engineers are able to learn a new framework & become proficient. Sort of like hiring someone to drive a red automatic sports car- even if they’ve only driven blue stick-shift trucks before, you’re not that worried as long as their smart, driven, and able to learn new things.
