Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a recent Dev Bootcamp alum. This email exchange took place in August 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the student ‘John’.

My Email:
Hi John,Thanks for offering advice from your experience at Dev Bootcamp. I’m trying to make an informed decision between the various coding bootcamps available and any insights you can provide are much appreciated. I have 3 questions:1) What is your opinion of the overall quality of the program?2) How difficult was it to find a job upon graduating?3) If you had to choose, would you do Dev Bootcamp all over again?Thanks for your help and I appreciate your time!Best,Christian
Email Response:
DBC is an extremely high quality program. They create an environment that allows you to learn as much as possible in a very short time frame. It’s all about keeping you on the edge between comfort and frustration. They teach you how to teach yourself, and how to develop with empathy. You will be pair programming every day and spend most waking moments thinking about code. It is exhausting and extremely rewarding. It’s a life changing experience that I would do again if I had the time and money.Finding a job after graduating is not a given and can take some time, however, the opportunities are vast. I found myself interviewing with companies that I wasn’t sure I was ready to work for, so I took an internship instead which has greatly improved my confidence. As far as DBC helping you get a job, it’s different for each person and each cohort. My cohort didn’t have a high number of companies attend graduation which was frustrating. But others have had success finding a job via DBC’s help. You will become a part of a growing network of alumni you can tap into in your job search and career.Hope that helps,John
