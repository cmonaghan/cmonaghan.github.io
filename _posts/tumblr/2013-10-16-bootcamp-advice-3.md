Here is a transcript of the advice I received from the VP of Engineering at a small SF-based tech company. This email exchange took place in June 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the VP ‘John’ and the company ‘Widgets Inc.’

My Email:
Hi,
This may be an unusual request, but I’m applying to Dev Bootcamp & App Academy with the goal of becoming a junior web developer. Widgets Inc. is listed as a partner employer so I wanted to reach out to you and ask a few questions about your experience with bootcamp graduates in order to make sure this program will adequately prepare me for a job upon graduation.
I have 3 questions:
1) Are you currently hiring junior web developers? (Is the market for junior developers really as hot as they say)
2) In your experience, do you feel that these bootcamps adequately prepare graduates to be successful as developers upon graduation?
3) In your experience is one program better than another as far as quality of graduates, proficiency, etc.?
I appreciate your time. This is a huge investment for me and your advice will help me make the right decision. Thanks for your help!
Cheers,
Christian

Email Response:
Hi Christian, thanks for reaching out and I appreciate your interest in being well informed. Big decision.
Thoughts below…

1) Are you currently hiring junior web developers? (Is the market for junior developers really as hot as they say)

We’re always on the lookout for great people. We try to maintain a balance of early-career folks and more experienced so we have adequate bandwidth to mentor while getting stuff done, and may be a little heavy on the former at this point, but have found that someone who blows us away will always make breaking this “rule” worthwhile.

2) In your experience, do you feel that these bootcamps adequately prepare graduates to be successful as developers upon graduation?

They do. I mean, nothing compares to real world working experience and even though these camps do a great job simulating it there’s still a jump, but the folks we’ve hired have turned out well.
I will say that probably has more to do with the fact we’re hiring the top folks from these. The dedication, drive, smarts, maturity, humility, and emotional intelligence that enables them to be the top is probably the higher order factor for their success.

3) In your experience is one program better than another as far as quality of graduates, proficiency, etc.?

That’s hard to say with a relatively small sample size. We’ve hired more from Dev Bootcamp but not sure that says anything about either program.
