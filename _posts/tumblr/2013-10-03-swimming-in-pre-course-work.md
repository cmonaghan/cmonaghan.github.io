Upon getting accepted to the program, I was given 40-80 hours of pre-course work to complete before the program starts in 8 weeks. (Whenever I’m given a range of hours, I always expect the high end and then add some more on top of that, which has proven fairly accurate so far). It’s not so unmanageable, except for the fact that I have a full-time job and really only have two options to make time for coding: either before work or after work. I’ve opted for the after-work solution, so as soon as I get off work I go to a local café where I’m forced to be productive.
Once you finish the 40-80 hours of pre-course work, there is a whole host of ‘recommended’ preparation materials to go through. While none of these are required, I want to make sure I get through these too so I start on the strongest foot possible. Then, if you’re really ambitious (which I am), you can go through all the pre-course work a second time. If you finish all that and get bored, just email the Hack Reactor staff and they’ll give you a whole bunch more to do. Basically there’s always more to learn.
So far I’m about 70% done with the required pre-course work, and it’s taken me about 4 weeks to get this far. Here are some of the projects I’m working on in the pre-course work:
A relatively short and easy exercise going through the basics of JavaScript — With my basic knowledge of JavaScript from taking the JavaScript Codecademy course, and my additional work preparing for the Hack Reactor technical interview, I found this fairly easy.
A few different Git tutorials — Having no prior exposure to Git, this has all been new territory for me. At first it was quite intimidating to use the command line for the first time and to type in scary commands, but Git is actually fairly easy to use. (Granted, I’m only doing basic stuff with it.)
A reimplementation of the underscore.js library — There are about 2 or 3 dozen functions we have to rewrite. Some of these are easy, and some I find quite difficult. I’m only 80% of the way through this one.
A small twitter app clone using jQuery – Since I’m not too strong in jQuery, I’ve had to do a lot of jQuery learning, which is great because this is immensely valuable to know. The more I can get my stumbling out of the way now, the faster I’ll be able to run once the program starts.
An 8-12 hours project called Recurion – This project has the most intimidating description of “Probably the most difficult part of our prep work that should not be held off to the last minute”. Ironically enough, I have yet to start this project.
A short 2-4 hour introduction to Backbone.js – I haven’t started this one yet.
And then the recommended ‘optional’ coursework includes:
Tutorials in CSS, HTML, CoffeeScript, advanced Git functions, Ruby, and Rails
It’s all a lot to swallow, but I can see real progress in my learning already, and it’s not even day 1 yet!
