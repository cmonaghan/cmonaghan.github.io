After one long, intense week, I can say I’ve survived my first week at Hack Reactor! (Also affectionately referred to as ‘Hell Week’.) In the first 6 days we had 27 lectures (roughly an entire semester’s worth of lectures out in the ‘traditional’ world), interspersed with coding exercises and small projects. I have NEVER learned so much in one week. The pace of learning is unbelievably fast. For example, we may have a lecture at 9am, followed by another lecture at 11am, with an hour to work on our paired project exercises in between. And the lecture at 11am builds on the concepts from the 9am lecture, so if the concepts are still shaky for you, you better learn them by 11am.

Fortunately, we have two big advantages on our side: 1) The Hack Reactor team have their material down to a science and do a phenomenal job breaking down the concepts into logical steps that build on what we already know, and 2) The Hack Reactor team have done a very thorough job screening for applicants that are incredibly driven, ambitious, and bright. I am in awe of the quality of my peers. Amongst us we have lawyers, hardware engineers, college dropouts, recent college grads, people fresh out of the navy, and even a neuroscience PhD. The one thing everyone has in common is they are incredibly bright and driven. The energy in the room just crackles.

Week 1 was very intense, but also very rewarding. I know worlds more than I knew just 7 days ago. I’m much more comfortable with concepts that were previously fuzzy to me, such as object prototypes, the ‘this’ variable, ‘call’ and ‘apply’, and classes, among others. Now here comes week 2!
