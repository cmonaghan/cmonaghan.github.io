<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/power-advice.jpg" width="60%" align="right">Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a Hack Reactor student who had recently finished the program at the time I contacted him. This email exchange took place in August 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the student ‘John’.

<b>My LinkedIn Message:</b>

Hi John,

Thanks for offering advice from your experience at Hack Reactor. I want to make an informed decision between the various coding bootcamps available and any insights you can provide are much appreciated. 

I have 3 questions:

1) What is your opinion of the overall quality of the program?

2) If you had to choose, would you do Hack Reactor all over again?

3) Is there anything else you think I should know before going in?

Thanks for your help and I appreciate your time!

Best,

Christian

1) What is your opinion of the overall quality of the program?

> Amazing. There is an increased demand for Javascript developers lately. I’m too busy at the moment to give you the in-depth answer you seek. How about you visit HackReactor during the Alumni Panel this Friday. It’s an event where graduants talk about their job search etc.

> sidenotes: If my friend who has had no programming experience before HR now makes 6 figures programming something must be working. If they have 100% employment nearly all of them now are starting 6 figure salary then something must be going on here. It would be easier if you show up Friday and see for yourself rather then analyzing everything to death

2) If you had to choose, would you do Hack Reactor all over again?

> I wish I could do it all year.

3) Is there anything else you think I should know before going in?

> just sign up already seats are filling up fast.
