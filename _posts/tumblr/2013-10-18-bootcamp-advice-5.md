Here is a transcript of the advice I received from the cofounder of a small SF-based tech startup. This email exchange took place in July 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the cofounder ‘John’ and the company ‘Widgets Inc.’

My Email:
Hi,
I’m applying to Dev Bootcamp with the goal of being hired as a junior web developer upon graduation. Widgets Inc. is listed on their site as a partner employer so I wanted to reach out to you and ask a few questions about your experience with Dev Bootcamp graduates.
I have 2 questions:
1) Are you currently hiring any junior web developers? (Is the market for junior developers really as hot as they say)
2) In your experience, do you feel that Dev Bootcamp adequately prepare graduates to be successful as developers upon graduation?
I appreciate your time. This is a huge investment for me and your advice will help me make the right decision. Thanks for your help!
Cheers,Christian

Email Response:
Hi Christian,
For the record, we never actually hired anyone from Dev Bootcamp. The market is definitely hot, but I am somewhat skeptical of the program. I think someone disciplined could learn as much on their own time and have projects to show for it, for a lot less money, although it would be more difficult without the peer support.
We’re always hiring juniors but I’m much more interested in seeing the projects you’ve completed - however small - than in having attended Dev Bootcamp.
Best of luck in the journey.
John
