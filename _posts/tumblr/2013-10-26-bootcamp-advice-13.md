<img src="/post_resources/tumblr-images/power-advice.jpg" width="60%" align="right">Here is a transcript of the advice I received from a Hack Reactor alum. This email exchange took place in August 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the student ‘John’.

<b>Chat History:</b>

Hi John. How are you?

<i>John</i>
hey man, i’m well
how are you?

<i>Christian</i>
I’m good. congrats on your new job.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your experience at hack reactor?

<i>John</i>
thx man
sure thing
shoot away

<i>Christian</i>
what is your opinion of the overall quality of the program?

<i>John</i>
10/10
there is no better program
I’ve been around Dev Bootcamp, I actually did General Assembly
Hack Reactor is way better

<i>Christian</i>
That’s good to hear. Did you apply to Dev Bootcamp?

<i>John</i>
yea, I applied and interviewed and then decided to go GA instead
then wasn’t happy with GA, so one of the TA’s there was also a TA at Hack Reactor and told me I should do that

<i>Christian</i>
How easy was it to find a job after Hack Reactor?
And now that you’re working, do you feel that you know enough to be successful in your job?

<i>John</i>
easy and yest
I didn’t go into hack reactor to get a job
and pretty much skipped the last 2-3 weeks since I already knew I was going back to my start-up
and it was still easy to get a job 3 months later when I decided to leave my start up
I didn’t apply to a single job, had 5-6 offers

<i>Christian</i>
that’s encouraging to hear

<i>John</i>
a lot of it is where you start going into the program too
I had been coding for my start-up for a bout 6 months, did another 3 after, so I was able to leverage that experience in addition to HR to get a job
well, i leveraged that experience to get a higher paying better job

<i>Christian</i>
ok
assuming I get into hack reactor and do the program, what do you think is the key to being successful? (I imagine joining the program is only the first step
worded that badly: **what is the key to being successful once in the program?

<i>John</i>
i don’t know there is a golden bullet… I wish I could say I was the guy that was staying late every night, but I wasn’t. There is also a lot I could have done differently to get more out of it
by staying later, building more, and not checking out early
I still don’t know backbone
b/c I went through the backbone sprint, didn’t get it at the time very well, and never built anything with it
but I know other frameworks like Angular and Meteor really well, because I’d actually built stuff in them
you won’t remember almost anything unless you take the sprint, do a good job at it, then actually apply it in real life
that’s why the guys that stay late do better, b/c in that extra time, they’re applying what they learned in the sprint
to real stuff

<i>Christian</i>
good advice. I’ll keep that in mind
I think that answers the burning questions I had. Is there anything else you wish you knew when you started?

<i>John</i>
I was in the 2nd class ever and i started the program 48 hours after I applied… haha… so I wasn’t really the typical person and a lot has changed
so, i wish I had done the stuff they tell you to have done and more
they are people in the program that come in with tons of experience under their belt, and you’ll always be behind them if you don’t, but that’s ok
there are different jobs for different people
at [my current company], i feel really comfortable in the fact that i’m not a JS rockstar yet
b/c most people aren’t
some people do come out of HR as JS rockstars, but they were already really awesome before they even got there

<i>Christian</i>
ok. that’s good for me to keep inmind
Thanks for your advice!

<i>John</i>
np, if you get in, I’d totally do it
it’s a life changer
also, a plug for the teachers, those guys are so cool. They have become my friends, I still go back there to just hang with them

<i>Christian</i>
I had my first in-person interview with tony on tuesday. technical interview next week. I definitely get the sense that they are very approachable and really care about the students

<i>John</i>
yup, they’re not trying to just make money like General Assembly
they are making good money… but that’s not the point for them

<i>Christian</i>
Cool. thanks for your time. I have to run

<i>John</i>
late
best of luck

<i>Christian</i>
thx
