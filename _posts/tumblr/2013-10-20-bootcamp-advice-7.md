Here is a transcript of the advice I received from the cofounder of a small SF-based tech startup in July 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the cofounder ‘John’ and the company ‘Widgets Inc.’

My Email:
Hi,
This may be an unusual request, but I’m applying to Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco with the goal of being hired as a junior web developer upon graduation. Widgets Inc. is listed on their site as a partner employer so I wanted to reach out to you and ask a few questions about your experience with Dev Bootcamp graduates.
I have 2 questions:
1) Are you currently hiring any junior web developers? (Is the market for junior developers really as hot as they say)
2) In your experience, do you feel that Dev Bootcamp adequately prepare graduates to be successful as developers upon graduation?
I appreciate your time. This is a huge investment for me and your advice will help me make the right decision. Thanks for your help!
Cheers,
Christian

Email Response:
Hi Christian,
Thank you for reaching out.
1) Are you currently hiring any junior web developers? (Is the market for junior developers really as hot as they say)

We are currently not hiring any junior web developers. However, that said, we are entertaining the idea of contract to hire or internship/apprenticeship to hire as subcontracting remotely hasn’t really worked out well for us either.
I don’t know about the market at large, however.

2) In your experience, do you feel that Dev Bootcamp adequately prepare graduates to be successful as developers upon graduation?

I don’t think any bootcamp can adequately prepare someone in 9 weeks. Development is a craft like any other craft and takes a long time to master. I think what Dev Bootcamp does is to weed out people who are truly interested in development, and grok development, to continue pursuing the path.

What are you hoping to get out of a program like Dev Bootcamp? What is your ultimate goal? To be hired as developer? To start your own project?
Feel free to keep the conversation going.
John

We had a few back and forth emails after this, but I’ve omitted them here because they are more about my personal coding background and of less value to other readers.
