Today I did some research into how to build my own model using my own datasets. In particular I was curious how to build a chatbot that is trained to respond as Benjamin Franklin might. It would need to be trained on all his writings, quotes, and biographical information.

Granted, there is probably enough material about Ben Franklin already on the internet and in the GPT-4o training set that the extra step to train is unnecessary, but I want to learn more generally how to train a model, so it seems a useful exercise for learning.

So, for a future mini-project, I think I may actually break this into two mini-projects:
1. Ben Franklin chatbot simply using GPT-4o
2. Ben Franklin chatbot trained on a custom dataset atop a pre-trained model via transfer learning
