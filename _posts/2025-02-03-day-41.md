Today I fine-tuned an LLM model. I started out with [this unsloth tutorial](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/tutorial-how-to-finetune-llama-3-and-use-in-ollama), where we fine-tune atop llama 3.

The tutorial lays everything out in a relatively straightforward way. It's quite easy to run the pre-defined python notebook.

Next I'd like to try running these same steps on my own M4 macbook. And if that works, then try running with a new training dataset, and eventually fine-tuning a model for Benchling using our extensive dataset of past Terraform Cloud runs.
