title:  "100 Days of Gen AI: Day 3"
---

It's been a while since my last entry. Life got busy and I didn't make enough time for learning, but now I'm back!

Today I went through the [OpenAI quickstart guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python), which was quite easy -- I was up and running in 5 minutes. I should have started out here all along!

I got my first equivalent of a hello world app running in python. I also read through the [OpenAI prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) which was a helpful way to start thinking of different strategies for implementing some of the AI projects I want to build.

Some ideas for future projects that came to mind during this process are:
- A gift recommendation engine for GoWishbone
- Take user feedback and a product roadmap as inputs, and explain to the user how their feedback is being addressed (or not addressed) by the product roadmap
- Have a conversation with Ben Franklin as if you two were having a beer in a colonial-era pub
- A code assistant that writes unit tests, and a separate application that runs these tests in a sandboxed environment, sending the feedback back to the model, allowing the model to iterate and fix issues
- Observability SRE monitoring: given past monitor inputs, investigations and root cause outputs, suggest issues to consider based on current monitor inputs
- Content moderation tool
- Code review bot
- Train your own AI persona, automate replies to messages in your own voice
- Identify logical fallacies in text/speech, compare different political figures by types of fallacies and rates of committing them
- Fact checking assistant
