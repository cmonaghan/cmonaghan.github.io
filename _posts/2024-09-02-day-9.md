I've finished up Fallacy Finder. It now returns an actual response from OpenAI rather than returning dummy data. You can see it live here: [https://fallacy.woolgathering.io/](https://fallacy.woolgathering.io/)

Here's what it looks like:

It lists each fallacy, quotes it, and then explains why it's a logical fallacy.

I also used ChatGPT to create a favicon for my project, in the style of a 1980s video game. It produced these four designs, and I went with the bottom right:

There are some obvious improvements I could make here, but I'm going to skip so I can move onto the next project. The next improvements I *would* make are:
* Handle the case where we exceed the token limit and incomplete json is returned (right now this just fails to parse and produces an error)
* Add a spinner after clicking submit. Since it takes a few seconds to get a response, it's not clear to the user that something is happening without a spinner.
