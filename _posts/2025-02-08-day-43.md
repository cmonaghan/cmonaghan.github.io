An idea I've wanted to explore is how to turn a paper form into an API. The basics would be to take a photo of the form, use OCR to extract the field names, and create a data schema from this. A web endpoint could then be created that can handle future submissions for this form schema and save them to a database. 

Then when subsequent forms of the same type are submitted, it would automatically extract the form data (which could be handwritten), present the OCR results to the user for any corrections, and submit to the existing web endpoint, saving this to the database.

I think there's also an interesting use case to provide the opposite tranformation---use an API to convert database information into a paper form (or digital PDF). Why would you ever want to do that? The use case here would be for submitting to organizations that still require paper (or digital PDF) form submissions (such as a doctors office filing health insurance claims).

I have no prior experience with OCR technologies, but let's see what they can do. Continuing with my interest in Golang, I found an OCR server using tesseract written in go that I can run locally ([https://github.com/otiai10/ocrserver](https://github.com/otiai10/ocrserver)) and I ran this with:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 otiai10/ocrserver
```

I searched for a good example form and found a drivers license application for New Hampshire.

I uploaded this to my local OCR server:

Here's the OCR result. It seems to be about equal parts accurate, and equal parts jibberish. Here's what it reads:
