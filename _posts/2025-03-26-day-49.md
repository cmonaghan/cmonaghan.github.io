Today I setup a custom domain for the project tracking friend recommendations. I renamed it from RecTrackr to FriendFaves and now have it hosted here: [https://friendfaves.woolgathering.io/](https://friendfaves.woolgathering.io/).

I also added it to the projects page for all to see!

Now I think it's time to start on a new project...
