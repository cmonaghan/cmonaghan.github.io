Previously, I created my existing AWS slackbot resources using a Cloudformation template from a blog post.

Today I did a few things:
1. I imported all the existing AWS resources for the slackbot into Terraform (not including the Bedrock resources)
2. Deleted the initial Cloudformation stack
3. I refactored my terraform resources to use the public [terraform-aws-lambda](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda) module

If I were to do this again, I would have just started with the public terraform module and skipped the Cloudformation intermediary steps. Lesson learned for next time!
