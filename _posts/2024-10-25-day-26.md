Today I started refactoring the slackbot infrastructure components into a reusable terraform module. This consists of an API Gateway, a Lambda (both using public modules), plus an IAM policy and a Secrets Manager resource.

I started looking into representing the Bedrock components in terraform as well, but discovered these are not yet supported by the Terraform AWS provider. I think I will just define a manual runbook for how to setup the Bedrock resources and then we can manage this in Terraform once its supported.
