Today I'm setting up a slackbot template that can be used for any kind of ChatGPT-backed slackbot, deployed on AWS Lambda. I will then use this template for the Terraform Cloud FAQ slackbot that I discussed in my last post.

I built a template repo here: [https://github.com/cmonaghan/slackbot-template](https://github.com/cmonaghan/slackbot-template)

Here's an example of it working via my local Flask server:

I still need to document how to host this. For next time!
