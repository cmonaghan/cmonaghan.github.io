<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I’m a Swede who started my first job as a designer in 1998. I’ve since worked as a creative &amp; art director, and photographer in a number of different companies — large and small, my own and others — including Spray, Lear Corporation, Notion and Spotify. More information can be found on LinkedIn.</p>

<h2 id="spotify">Spotify</h2>

<p>Since 2006 I’ve primarily worked with Spotify (a music platform). I’m the acting creative &amp; art director, interaction designer and graphic designer as well as shooting both still and moving pictures. The brand identity (logotype, business cards, style guides, etc) is my work as well as the different end user client applications (interaction design).</p>

<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>

<p>Made my first capture when I was about 6 years old. Picked up on the interest later in life, or more specifically in 1998, when I got access to a small but real photo lab. Since then I’ve been an active/passive hobby/pro photographer in waves.</p>

<p>My photos have been published world wide — print and online — in publications including The New York Times, The Guardian, Wired, BBC, Forbes and The Economist.</p>

<h2 id="software_development">Software development</h2>

<p>Some of my active open-source projects include Smisk (web service framework) and Gitblog (blogging &amp; publishing tool). I’m also involved (or have been involved) in a few larger projects including MacPorts, Tango (D standard library), Adium instant messager and Lighttpd. There are also a number of commercial applications I’ve written (for Spray, Spotify, Livebloggen, and others).</p>
