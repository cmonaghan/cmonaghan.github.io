    <div class="body"><p>Here is a transcript of the advice I received from two recruiters at one of the largest, established, Bay Area internet companies. This email exchange took place in July 2013. For anonymity, I’ll call the recruiters ‘Jane’ and ‘Jessica,’ and the company ‘Widgets Inc.’</p>

<p>My Email:
Hi Jane,
Thanks for offering your advice. I’m teaching myself to program and want to eventually work as a web developer for a startup in the Bay Area/San Francisco. I think you might be able to provide good insights with your position in talent acquisition at Widgets Inc.</p>

<p>I have two questions:
1) Do you have any experience hiring junior developers directly from coding bootcamps? (such as Dev Bootcamp, App Academy, Hack Reactor, Coding Dojo, etc.)
2) What languages/frameworks are in the highest demand in the job market? (ie - Ruby on Rails, Python, Javascript, etc.)</p>

<p>I appreciate your help and thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Christian</p>

<p>Email Response:
Hello Christian,I apologize for the delay in my response! It’s been pretty busy at Widgets Inc. as of late, but I’m sure you’ve heard we’re committed to hiring bright recent grads. In fact, our CEO just highlighted that we want at the minimum to have our staff be 25% recent grads!1) Do you have any experience hiring junior developers directly from coding bootcamps? (such as Dev Bootcamp, App Academy, Hack Reactor, Coding Dojo, etc.)</p>

<p>Absolutely!! We try to attend many bootcamps and competitions since we know the talent is among the winners. I have directly hired from “Yahoo! Learning To Rank Challenge”, “ACM-Data Mining Camp hosted by eBay”, and others.</p>

<p>2) What languages/frameworks are in the highest demand in the job market? (ie - Ruby on Rails, Python, Javascript, etc.)</p>

<p>In my eyes right now big-data and presentation are at the foremost in demand. For both JavaScript is essential. However, not just writing JavaScript, actually delivering libraries, contributing to the source, etc is essential and really attracts attention.
Python is a language that every computer scientist should know because it allows you to build product easily, weather the products are used as prototypes or in products depends on the size of the company.
Scalability is another skill that will be in demand for the foreseeable future. Now that most people are online, in social networks, ecommerce, media, etc. any company that wants to stay in business has to address this starting from the UI/Front-End through the framework it supports.
OOP is essential knowledge from any perspective. If you know OO-JavaScript your resume will float to the top of any recruiter.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out anytime! I’d be happy to tell you more about what we look for when looking at resumes, what my advice would be for a recent grad, etc…Thanks!Jane</p>

<p>My Email:
Hi Jane,
Thanks for your thoughtful response! Last week I was accepted into my top 2 choices for coding bootcamp programs (Hack Reactor and Dev Bootcamp). Hack Reactor focuses on Javascript, and Dev Bootcamp focuses on Ruby on Rails. I haven’t made my final decision yet, but I’m leaning towards Hack Reactor. It’s very encouraging to know that OO-Javascript is in such high demand.
What do you look for in resumes and in a portfolio? As I enter one of these programs, I’ll have the choice to work on paid projects vs personal projects and I’ll also have a lot of latitude in choosing which projects to work on as I build my portfolio. Do you have any advice on where I should focus my time as I build my resume &amp; portfolio?
Thanks for your help Jane!
Christian</p>

<p>Email Response:
Hi again Christian,I will let you speak with Jessica, who at one point was a Front-End developer and currently is our resident expert in all things Front-End ;-)Jessica– kindly give Christian a couple of minutes and let him know what you look for in a resume?Thanks!
Jane</p>

<p>Email Response:
Hello Christian,That is awesome, congratulation! I would suggest Hack Reactor because of the focus on JS. JS jobs are in high demand and the talent pool is not very deep.We are looking for people who can create advanced OO Javascript’s that are optimized for all browsers and follow the industry best practices. It is good to have an understanding of the different JS frameworks like backbone, ember.js, angular.js, knockout, mustache, handlebar, etc….I also look for people who have worked on highly scalable and high volume websites as ours gets 100m+ hits per day. It is much different coding for a site with that type of volume and impact.Make sure you have a github account that you contribute to regularly and are ok with managers viewing. My managers like to see your coding style.Other things I look for in Front-end Engineers are:· HTML5 – know what the new features are and how to implement them
· CSS3 – know what the new features are and how to implement them. Be able to write your own style sheets. Take a look at LESS and SASS, as well as DUST – we use these in-house
· Jquery – need to be able to use the library to create your own features. A lot of people use it to manipulate the dom and for ajax, which is good.
· Strong CS fundamentals – data structures and algorithms; you will use them daily here at Widgets Inc. even as a Front-end Engineer
· Java – be able to read, modify, debug and integrate your code.
I wish you luck in your training!JessicaTalent Acquisition Specialist</p>
