        <span class="body">I was recently working on a project that required me to display large numbers to the user (in the hundreds of thousands or millions). No one wants to read a long string of zeros, trying to figure out if the number is 100000000 or 10000000. I figured someone must have already written a simple script to perform this exact operation but after a bit of searching, I came up empty. So I decided to write my own script and here I am sharing it with you.</span>

        <span class="body">After one long, intense week, I can say I’ve survived my first week at Hack Reactor! (Also affectionately referred to as ‘Hell Week’.) In the first 6 days we had 27 lectures (roughly an entire semester’s worth of lectures out in the ‘traditional’ world), interspersed with coding exercises and small projects. I have NEVER learned so much in one week. The pace of learning is unbelievably fast. For example, we may have a lecture at 9am, followed by another lecture at 11am, with an hour to work on our paired project exercises in between. And the lecture at 11am builds on the concepts from the 9am lecture, so if the concepts are still shaky for you, you better learn them by 11am.
Fortunately, we have two big advantages on our side: 1) The Hack Reactor team have their material down to a science and do a phenomenal job breaking down the concepts into logical steps that build on what we already know, and 2) The Hack Reactor team have done a very thorough job screening for applicants that are incredibly driven, ambitious, and bright. I am in awe of the quality of my peers. Amongst us we have lawyers, hardware engineers, college dropouts, recent college grads, people fresh out of the navy, and even a neuroscience PhD. The one thing everyone has in common is they are incredibly bright and driven. The energy in the room just crackles.
Week 1 was very intense, but also very rewarding. I know worlds more than I knew just 7 days ago. I’m much more comfortable with concepts that were previously fuzzy to me, such as object prototypes, the ‘this’ variable, ‘call’ and ‘apply’, and classes, among others. Now here comes week 2!

        <span class="body">The day is upon us! Today will be my first day at Hack Reactor. I’ve now had a week off since I quit my job, to decompress and prepare for the course. I used that time for a quick trip to relax on a tropical beach in Panama, courtesy of frequent flyer miles. Upon returning on Saturday I shaved my head and had a party to celebrate my new beginning. I plan not to cut my hair or shave for the duration of the course (except maybe at the end for job interviews). Now my skill at coding can be measured by the length of my hair and beard. (Some say dorky, I say baller.)
Hack Reactor here I come!
