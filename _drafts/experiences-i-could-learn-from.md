title:  "Experiences I Could Learn From"
author: "Christian"

I keep a running list of "experiences I could learn from." Whenever I think of something that might teach me something, I add it to the list. These experiences are not selected because they are enjoyable or an escape, but because I believe they would provide me a new perspective on reality and make my life richer for it. The further the experience is from my daily norm, the better.

I've been keeping this list ever since [my time working in a salmon cannery](link to cannery post) -- although it was brief, it was a profound experience that has made my life richer in numerous ways.

Some items on my list are job experiences, like my time working in the cannery, but others are experiences I can do right here in my free time, with less disruption to my life. Here's my current running list:


##### Experiences I could do right now:
- write my own eulogy
- write a love letter to myself
- meet with someone on Craigslist 'strictly platonic' and just have a casual conversation over coffee
- hang out in a local youth hostel
- Observe Ramadan or a similar fasting schedule
- Police ride-along
- Sensory deprivation float tank
- learn about perfuming and how to bottle scents

##### Experiences that require some investment:
- Deck hand on a freighter
- Smoke jumper
- Firespotter
- Live in a Lighthouse
- Work as a lumberjack
- Work in a ski chalet in the alps
- Live on the streets for 1 week with no money.
- Travel to many alternative living cultures. Visit the Amish, hippy communes, etc. Stay at each, observe, and then write a book comparing the values, benefits and downsides of each.
- Motorcycle from St. Petersburg to Moscow
- live in an american all-black community
- for a few months, live in a truly impoverished place and try to live as the locals do (think india)
- Work at McDonalds somewhere in the U.S.
- Take a wilderness survival training course
- Work on a ranch for a few months, maybe also write some software for them
- Live in complete isolation for 3 months
- volunteer firefighter
- work an ice cream truck
- work as a masseuse (invent two new types of massage: meditation massage, and relax training (where you alternate between a deep tissue movement, then a gentle movement that relaxes to train muscles to relax))
- spend a few months learnings to be a republican. live somewhere rural. write a book.
- Work as a caterer for the ultra-rich in New England. See how a different type of people live.
